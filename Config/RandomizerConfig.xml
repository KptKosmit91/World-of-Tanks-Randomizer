		<!--
		List of keywords (sperated by spaces) that the randomizer will find tanks by, and only use models of the found tanks
		
		For example:
		
		if we set keywords to:
		waffentrager_e100
		only the waffentrager e100 models will be used
		
		
		or if we set it to
		tiger sherman
		only models of all tigers (Tiger I, Tiger II, Jagdtiger, etc.) and shermans (Sherman Jumbos, Sherman 4 etc) will be used
		
		The search is done by *file names*, look in Source/res/scripts/item_defs/vehicles and the respective country folders for the file names.
		You can also use the country folder names as keywords! (don't use *common* though, won't do anything)
		
		UniqueRandomization is always `false` with keywords enabled
		
		Keep blank to disable
