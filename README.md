INSTALLING THE TOOL:

Download the tool first, by clicking "Clone or download" --> "Download as ZIP"
Extract the ZIP anywhere you want, I don't advise putting it anywhere in your World of Tanks folder.
Please note that this isn't a mod, this is a tool generates mods for you. More info below.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

USAGE:

Run generate.bat
Before running it you can also set your mod seed in Config/RandomizerConfig.xml. by default it is a random seed (setting it to 0 in the config will generate a random seed on every run, each seed provides different results in game)
Keep in mind, that changing the config won't alter existing .wotmod mods previously made by the program! You'll have to generate them again.
WARNING: Don't open folders beyond Output/res when running the randomizer, otherwise it will crash!
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

INSTALLING THE GENERATED MODS

After running the bat file and after the window displays "You are ready to install your mod!" go to the Output folder. Ignore the "res" folder. Copy the generated .wotmod file into World_of_Tanks/mods/(VersionFolder)
Don't confuse the "mods" folder with the "res_mods" folder!
And remember to only have one randomized mod installed in the game at a time.
